I had the pleasure of doing a free trial of Apple Music for 6 months and throughout my entire use of it all I could think about was returning to Spotify. However, I will say that Apple Music nailed it with the classic Music app formula that they were so well known for in their iPods. Nonetheless, the age of iPods is pretty much over and the old age of the music app now shows in comparison to Spotify. The main reasons for myself wanting to come back to Spotify was music recommendations, the ability to following artists, and lack of saving playlists regardless of subscription status.

## Music Recommendations

Spotify's music recommendation feature is one of the features I missed most because it is not present in Apple Music. Apple Music is so much like its original Music app in iPods because it was. In Apple Music, you are there for the music that you have saved and that's it. If you want to discover new music then you better go use the search bar. This is a brutal User Experience (UX) and one that I cannot highlight enough if you want to discover new music then you have to do it yourself manually. I would argue that this was one of the largest missed opportunities for Apple since Apple has had access to a huge library of music even before Spotify was born. Oh, do I remember the good old days of iTunes, do you?
